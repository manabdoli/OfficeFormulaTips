# Introduction
Adding mathematical equations could become a time-consuming task that frustrates students and adversely affects their learning experience: adding symbols one at a time from the Equation Editor menu options is too slow, and memorizing LaTeX commands and compiling the TeX files into PDF is too much work! Nowadays, most software/web applications support LaTeX or LaTeX-like commands and keyboard shortcuts that can speed up creating documents with professional looking math expressions; MS Word, MATLAB, Titanium are some familiar examples. This workshop focuses on MS Word that offers a low-entry level for learning commands that can speed up the typing process. In addition, we will demonstrate how skills learned in MS Word can be extended to other MS Office products (PowerPoint, OneNote, Excel) and other applications (Google Doc, iOS Pages, MATLAB, RMarkdown). These skills can also be used for adding equations in Titanium, which could be of interest to students as well as faculties.
